<br/>

## Academic Research Projects

*May - Aug. 2018*, **Research Intern** 

Johns Hopkins University, Department of Biostatistics, MD, US 

Project: *Inverse Odds Ratio-Weighted (IORW) Estimation for Causal Mediation Analysis*

Accomplishments:

* Conducted theoretical analyses on the IORW estimation method in mediation analysis on continuous and binomial cases 

* Applied the approach into practical models in genomics and conducted comprehensive simulations with real data

* Sought and developed more effective and flexible modifications to this method when dealing with high dimensional data 

<br/>

*Jan. - May 2018*, **Research Assistant**

The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Applied Mathematics, HK 

Project: *Mathematical Modeling and Prediction for Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) Mortality*

Accomplishments:

* Collected, processed and analyzed P&I mortality data and environmental indicators in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2016

* Applied latest machine learning method called ‘boost regression tree model’ in modeling of P&I mortality

* Obtained 95% prediction power in the project which was much better than other current models in P&I mortality studies
