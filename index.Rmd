### About Me

Hi, this is Junxian Chen, a current Master of Science student studying biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu).

I love statistics, data analyses and programming, and desire to pursue a career in the field of data science. 

At present, I have solid **knowledge in statistics** including causal inference and regression, modeling, time-series analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, etc. Besides, I got considerable **training in computing and programming**, especially in R and Python, in which I learned to perform data wrangling, pipelining, visualizations, and produce analysis reports, etc.I am also **familiar with machine learning and computer system ** for data science.

Besides taking courses, I have participated in multiple **scientific research projects** with professors and researchers. During those projects, I helped develop statistical methodology, conduct statistical analysis, and design algorithms for simulations.

Want to learn more about my experiences?

Sure! You can learn more about me and see my resume [here](about_page.html)!
