### About me

Hi, this is Junxian Chen, a current Master student studying biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu)!

I love doing data science and aim to develop a career in the field of data science. 

At present, I have solid knowledge in statistics inlcuding conducting hypothesis tests, time-series analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, etc. I also got sufficient training in programming, especially in R and Python. Besides taking courses, I have participated in multiple academic research projects with professors and researchers. During those projects, I helped develop statistical methodology, conduct statistical analysis, and design algorithms for simulations.

In my spare time, I love watching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). Please feel free to share with me your favorite YouTube channels!
